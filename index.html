    <p class="overlay__description">
      My name is Yasmina Dion<br>
      I have been working as a Lifeguard since 2019, and I absolutely love it! 
      I have taught hundreds of lessons to kids ages 2-15.
      Last year, I began giving private lessons part-time and fell in love with it. 
      I decided to make it my full-time summer job, in order to offer this service to as many people as possible. <br><br>
      I believe that the safety of your children is the most important aspect of the lessons, and improving their swimming skills is a basic life skill.
      Knowing how to properly swim can save a life.
      I have my National lifesaving course, my Olympic Way course, and my First Aid certifications.
      With me, kids will learn to get comfortable in the water, and they will improve their swimming techniques, but most of all, they will have a fun summer! <br><br>
      Being one-on-one with a child can help them develop their skills faster, as my attention is purely devoted to them.
      I will be able to correct every last detail in their technique, physically manipulate them, and, come up with an adapted lesson plan every week.
      I also have experience with children with special needs.<br><br>
      <strong>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you want to see my certifications.</strong>
